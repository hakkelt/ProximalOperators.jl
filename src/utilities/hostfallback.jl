# Host round-trip.
#
# A handful of operators cannot run on a device under any formulation available here: they
# call into a C library (OSQP), into a sparse factorization with no device equivalent
# (SPQR), into a packed-storage LAPACK routine reached by `ccall` with a `StridedVector`
# signature, or into an algorithm that is sequential in the length of the input with no
# independent blocks to spread across work-items (a single long `TotalVariation1D`).
#
# The alternative to a round-trip would be to throw, and that is the worse answer: it turns
# "this operator is not accelerated" into "this operator does not work", and it forces every
# caller who assembles a mixed problem to special-case one term. Copying to the host, running
# the existing CPU algorithm and copying back keeps the whole library usable on device data,
# at a cost that is visible and documented rather than hidden.
#
# What this deliberately does *not* do is convert the operator. Only the input and output
# are moved. An operator carrying its own data -- `LeastSquares(A, b)`, `IndAffine(A, b)` --
# is expected to have been built from host arrays, which is the realistic
# case for exactly the operators that end up here; its factorization is computed once at
# construction and would be destroyed by moving it per call.

implementation; see [`supports_device`](@ref) for which those are.

Warns once per operator type, because the difference between "runs on the GPU" and "is
copied to the CPU and back on every iteration" is a performance cliff that should not be
discovered by profiling.

    device_tier(f) -> Symbol

How `f` behaves on device storage. Every operator in the package *works* on device arrays;
this says at what cost.

* `:native` — runs as device kernels, through broadcasts, reductions and device BLAS.
* `:device_lapack` — runs natively where the backend provides the factorization it needs
  (`svd!`, `eigen!`), and takes a host round-trip where it does not. Which of the two
  happens is a property of the array package, not of this one, so it cannot be decided here.
* `:host` — always a host round-trip: no device formulation exists.

The coverage test in `test/test_gpu.jl` enumerates this, so an operator added later without
a device story has to declare a tier rather than simply failing.

"""
    runs_natively(op, x) -> Bool

Whether `x` can be handled without leaving the device, given that the operator's algorithm
needs `op` (typically `svd!` or `eigen!`).

The question is asked of the method table rather than of the array type, so that an operator
uses a device factorization exactly when one exists: CUDA.jl defines `svd!` for `CuMatrix`,
and `NuclearNorm` should then run on the device rather than being copied to the host for no
reason.

`hasmethod` is not the test, though, and that is the subtle part: `LinearAlgebra` defines
`svd!(::AbstractMatrix)` generically, so *every* array type has a method and `hasmethod`
answers `true` for all of them -- including backends whose only route through that generic
method is scalar indexing. What distinguishes a real device implementation is that some
other package owns it, so the owning module is what gets checked.
