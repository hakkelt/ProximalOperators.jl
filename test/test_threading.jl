# Threading contract.
#
# Two things are checked here, and they are deliberately different in kind:
#
#   * the *policy* -- `is_threaded` must report what will actually happen, and a
#     `threaded = false` operator must never thread, at any size, on any input;
#   * the *kernels* -- the threaded and serial paths must agree, and the threaded path must
#     not allocate in proportion to the input.
#
# Agreement is `rtol`, not `==`: `@batch reduction` and `@tturbo` both re-associate the sum,
# so the value differs in the last couple of digits. The written array, which involves no
# reduction, is compared exactly -- if that ever differs the kernel is wrong, not merely
# reassociated.
